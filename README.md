# intelligent monitoring system

In past few decades we have seen an increase in the usage of surveillance systems such as CCTVs
and portable monitoring devices. These are static but not intelligent. With the advent of Artificial
Intelligence, frameworks like Computer Vision has increased the scope of including additional
functionalities. This Intelligent Monitoring System adds to the conventional monitoring system with
advanced real time features such as face recognition, alarm on theft detection, visitors in/out detection
and motion detection. Emphasis is on doing the tasks mentioned above in real time. This is achieved
by using optimised algorithms available in OpenCV Library which improves the usage of machine
perception.
